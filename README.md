# Transformer Hub Project

Welcome to the Transformer Hub project! This project showcases various Natural Language Processing (NLP) use cases using Hugging Face Transformers. The application is built with Streamlit, providing an interactive user interface for real-time results.

## 🚀 Features

- **Text Summarization**: Generate concise summaries from long texts.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify text as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Question Answering**: Retrieve answers from a given context based on user questions.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identify and classify entities in the text.
- **Machine Translation**: Translate text between different languages.
- **Text Generation**: Generate coherent text based on a given prompt using GPT-based models.
- **Speech-to-Text**: Convert audio input into text.
- **Image Captioning**: Generate descriptive captions for images.

## 📦 Requirements

To run this project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can find the list of dependencies in the `requirements.txt` file. Here are the main libraries used:

- Hugging Face Transformers
- Streamlit
- Other necessary libraries for data processing and model handling

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/transformer-hub.git
   cd transformer-hub
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
